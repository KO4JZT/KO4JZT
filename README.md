🎓 17 year old hobbiest programmer looking to make more.

📝 Current Projects: [Horace](https://github.com/knights-of-academia/horace), [Archangel](https://github.com/archangeldevs/archangel), and Project E.

🏭 I also work as the Head of Engineering @ [KOA](https://knightsofacademia.org) and as a Product Manager @ [Camelot](https://camelot.fm)
